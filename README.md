# TBD-evaluation
Conventional experiments on Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) are built upon the belief that fixing the detections to different trackers is sufficient to obtain a fair comparison. Instead, ee argue how the true behavior of a tracker is exposed when evaluated by varying the input detections rather than by fixing them. We propose a systematic and reproducible protocol and a MATLAB toolbox for generating synthetic data starting from ground truth detections, a proper set of metrics to understand and compare trackers peculiarities and respective visualization solutions.

# Proposed tools
This MATLAB toolbox is composed of three main components:
* ciao
* cao
* miao
